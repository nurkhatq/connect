This suggests the speaker is asking about the person’s current plans. 'Do you go out' is present simple, used for habits, which doesn’t fit the specific time frame.

The response explains the purpose of leaving, making '’m going to buy' suitable. '’ll buy' suggests a spontaneous decision, less likely here, and '’m buying' implies an action already in progress, which doesn’t fit the intent."

Second gap: The present simple ('Do you often go') is used to ask about general habits or routines.

The sentence suggests it is currently raining, justifying staying, so '’s raining' is correct. The present simple ('rains') would describe a general weather pattern, not the current situation. Second gap: The present simple ('don’t have') is used for general states or possession. The speaker states they do not possess an umbrella as a general fact, making 'don’t have' correct.
